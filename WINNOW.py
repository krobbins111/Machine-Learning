#WINNOW 


#Noise level 1 (no noise), level 2 (boundary cases), level 3 (completely out of place classifiers)
# Level 1 will represent the control and compared to other levels to see how they suffer

#CLASS LABEL NOISE: an example surrounded by examples of a different class or when an example is in the gray area between classes

#Perhaps use poor classes that will overlap easily in domain


#Need to make up examples for two classes with number integers (intelligence scale 1-10 and effort scale 1-10)
#Question would be to see if someone is an honor student

#make linear classifier for easy smart, hardworking to student in honor class

#low effort, low intelligence into not honor

#class label noise represents lazy geniuses and hardworking fails as well as close mix in the middle

#perceptron learn and winnow
#polynomials?
