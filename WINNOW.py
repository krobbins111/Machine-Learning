#WINNOW 
#separate test cases for increasing k and increasing noise
# 3 NN, 5 NN, 7 NN
#Noise level 1 (no noise), level 2, level 3
# Level 1 will represent the control and compared to other levels to see how they suffer

#CLASS LABEL NOISE: an example surrounded by examples of a different class or when an example is in the gray area between classes

#Perhaps use poor classes that will overlap easily in domain
